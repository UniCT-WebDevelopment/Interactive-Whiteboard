THE PROJECT:

This is an Interactive Whiteboard made by the collaboration between Eleonora Giuffrida (aka x-Lele-x) and Luigi La Spina, 
students of University of Catania during the "Web development Design and Usability" course.
In order to share the whiteboard, you need to open a Node.js command prompt, select project's directory,
then starting the server (write "node server.js" on the command prompt).
After that, you'll need to share the url on the command prompt to your colleagues.

You can choose between two main modalities: Scrawl Game and a simple interactive whiteboard.
The first one is a Game where players compete to draw the words given by the dictionary in the folder 
(you can also change the words in the txt file), while the second one consist in an interactive whiteboard
where you can draw and write on a private room with a code that can be shared.
